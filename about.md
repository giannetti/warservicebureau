The War Service Bureau edition is an ongoing pedagogical project to teach digital editing with the TEI. We adapted an [introductory text encoding assignment](https://github.com/giannetti/TEI-Close-Reading) from M. H. Beal's [close reading seminar activity](https://github.com/mhbeals/TEI-Close-Reading). More to come on reusing the letter metadata to create visualizations.  


## Data and Software

The War Service Bureau digital edition uses the [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) static site generator with the [Ed theme](https://minicomp.github.io/ed/) for minimal editions. 

The TEI-XML encodings of the letters, together with the project schema and various processing stylesheets, may be found at <https://github.com/rutgersdh/wsb-data>.
